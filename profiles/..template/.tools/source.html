<!--
  PASTE PAGE SOURCE HERE

  How to get the source:
  1. Open the profile page in your browser
  2. Press F12 to open DevTools
  3. In the Elements tab, right-click the <html> tag at the very top
  4. Click Copy > Copy outerHTML
  5. Select everything below this comment block and paste over it

  IMPORTANT: Use DevTools copy (Copy outerHTML), NOT View Page Source!
  View Source gives raw HTML before React renders — text content like
  comments, interests, lore, and about me will be empty.
